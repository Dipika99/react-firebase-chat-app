This repository contains the source code for a real-time chat application built using React and Firebase. The app leverages Firebase's Firestore for data storage, Firebase Authentication for user management, and React for the front-end framework. The result is a modern, responsive, and scalable chat application that provides real-time messaging capabilities.
